<h1>Kanto Money run</h1>
Whenever I do some Kanto money run, I like to do the Gym trainers first then the NPC trainers (the beauty) then I go off to Isle 5 (Five) to earn easy money. Also don't forget the Amulet coin buff. These are pretty cheap nowaday on GTL, can be easily purchase for around $15,000 or less. It pays itself off after a single gym trainer in Kanto. Other available option for Amulet coin is to farm it. Also, I highly recommend that you purchage an Ocarina Fly for $500,000 on GTL. It will help you greatly with your mobility.

Below is the table of my personal money run earning for Kanto:

|Source|No Amulet|Amulet Coin|
|---|---|---|
|Gym|$71,968|$107,952|
|NPC|$10,640|$15,960|
|Island|$6,528|9,792|
|Total|$89,136|$133,704|

<h1 id="npc">NPC Trainer</h1>
The NPC can be found in the route mentioned below, not all routes are mandatory but I really enjoy doing Route 13 and Route 15 (the beauties) since they pay a lot of money and are quick to do. If the name is in <span style="color:green">green</span> it means optional, only does this if you are truly desperate for cash. Again, all of them are done with Amulet Coin buff.

<ul>
    <li><a style="color:green" href="#route11">Route 11</a></li>
    <li><a style="color:green" href="#route8">Route 8</a></li>
    <li><a href="#route15">Route 15</a></li>
    <li><a href="#route13">Route 13</a></li>
    <li></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="route11" style="color:green">Route 11</h2>
Fly to Vermillion, head southeast into Route 11. Fight 4 Gamers here.

<img title='route11' src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/maps/route11.png">

<h2 id="route8" style="color:green">Route 8</h2>
Fly to Lavender then go west into Route 8. Fight 2 Gamers here.

<img title='route8' src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/maps/route8.png">

<h2 id="route15">Route 15</h2>
Fly to Fuchsia and head east into Route 15. Fight 2 Beauty here.

<img title='route15' src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/maps/route15.png">

<h2 id="route13">Route 13</h2>
Fly to Fuchsia and head east into Route 15. Fight 2 Beauty here.

<img title='route13' src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/maps/route13.png">

<h1 id="island">Island Run</h1>
Make sure to have your Amulet Coin Boost on before trying it for maximum effectiveness. Personally I only do the green dot on Isle 5 as the other isn't time efficient in my personal opinion. I will leave the others there for your convenience, but I would only recommend to do them if you didn't complete other region, otherwise, effort would be better spent focusing on other region. If you want to do all Island, I recommend you to buy some Repel to be able to reach the trainer quicker.
<ul>
    <li><a href="#isle5">Isle 5</a></li>
    <li><a style="color:green" href="#isle6">Isle 6</a></li>
    <li><a style="color:green" href="#isle7">Isle 7</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id='isle5'>Isle 5</h2>
The green dots on the northern island are the best trainers in the game for cash, always do those. The Ladies at Resort Generous (north of Isle 5) give 3,264 pokeyen without the Amulet Coin Boost and 4,896 pokeyen with Amulet Coin.

<img title='isle5' src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/maps/isle5.png">

<h2 id='isle6' style="color:green">Isle 6</h2>
Do every single trainer here, 

- Juggler Edward gives $1,920 without the Amulet Coin Boost and $2,880 with it.

<h2 id='isle7' style="color:green">Isle 7</h2>
 The two to the north are alright I guess, I do those when I'm not lazy. The first group of green circles to the south are good, the one is a doubles trainer which I'm not fond of but they only have 2 Pokemon and give about 3k, worth it. As you're going east, there is another doubles trainer battle, they have like 5-6 Pokemon and I find double battles annoying when I'm not paying attention so I usually just skip it, you can do it though. The rest to the south are all good, so do those.
