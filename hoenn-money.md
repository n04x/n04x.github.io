# Hoenn Money Run
Whenever I do some Hoenn money run, I like to do the Gym trainers first then the NPC trainers. Also don't forget the Amulet coin buff. These are pretty cheap nowaday on GTL, can be easily purchase for around $15,000 or less. It pays itself off after a single gym trainer in Kanto. Other available option for Amulet coin is to farm it. Also, I highly recommend that you purchage an Ocarina Fly for $500,000 on GTL. It will help you greatly with your mobility.

Below is the table of my personal money run earning for Hoenn:
|Source|No Amulet|Amulet Coin|
