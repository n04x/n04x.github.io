# Hoenn Money Run
Whenever I do some Hoenn money run, I like to do the Gym trainers first then the NPC trainers. Also don't forget the Amulet coin buff. These are pretty cheap nowaday on GTL, can be easily purchase for around $15,000 or less. It pays itself off after a single gym trainer in Kanto. Other available option for Amulet coin is to farm it. Also, I highly recommend that you purchage an Ocarina Fly for $500,000 on GTL. It will help you greatly with your mobility.

Below is the table of my personal money run earning for Hoenn:
|Source|No Amulet|Amulet Coin|

- **Slaking**, **Linoone**, **Spinda**, **Blissey**, **Stantler**, **Stoutland**, **Granbull**, **Bouffalant**, **Zangoose** and **Tauros** are all Normal types. They're weak to Fighting attacks and immune to Ghost moves.
- **Staraptor** is Normal/Flying. He's weak to Rock, Electric, and Ice attacks but immune to Ground and Ghost moves. 
- **Kecleon** and **Castform** start out as Normal types. They're initially weak to Fighting attacks and immune to Ghost moves. Because of their abilities, they may change their types. Kecleon will change to whatever type the move that last hit him was, gaining their resistances and weaknesses. Castform will change depending on the weather (Fire in sunshine, Water in rain, and Ice in hailstorms). You can use this chart of basic Pokémon matchups to determine what move is most effective against them. 
**Sawsbuck** is Normal/Grass. She's weak to Fighting, Flying, Poison, Bug, Fire and Ice attacks but immune to Ghost moves.
